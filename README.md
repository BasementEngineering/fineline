<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Embarking on the journey of investment can often feel like navigating through a labyrinthine world of financial jargon, fluctuating markets, and endless indicators. This complexity, however, masks an underlying truth: ***mastering the art of investing is not just a route to potential financial growth, but a crucial skill for securing our future.*** 

Learning to invest is learning to harness the power of the market to work in one's favor, turning the seemingly inscrutable web of options into a roadmap towards financial independence. Still, we will believe that learning to invest can lead to creating a sustainable future.

In this context, Gen Z emerges as a particularly vibrant and promising demographic for the investment landscape. This generation is adept at leveraging digital platforms for investing, and keenly follows financial trends through social media. The influence of family dynamics and a vision for long-term financial goals, underscores their potential as savvy investors. 

Addressing the needs and preferences of Gen Z is pivotal, considering their significant representation in the global population (30%) and their potential for future investments (considering and average of USD 4.000 per person). For them, investment is not just about financial growth but is intrinsically linked to achieving financial independence and securing a sustainable future.

During the hackathon, we conducted a market research study to delve into the investment behaviors and inclinations of Generation Z. We get the insight that even though 56% of the people are currently engaged as investors, an additional 83% of them indicate an interest in starting to invest. This 83% represents a wellspring of untapped potential, ready to be guided and molded  into informed investors.

During the hackathon, we conducted market research to explore the investment behaviors and preferences of Generation Z. Our findings revealed that while 56% of respondents are already active investors, an additional 83% expressed an interest in starting to invest. Another critical insight was that many potential investors are hindered from entering the market due to time constraints and the overwhelming volume of information available. This significant group represents a wealth of untapped potential, awaiting guidance and education to navigate the complexities of investing and become informed investors.

Understanding the unique needs and constraints of Generation Z, we are proud to introduce a groundbreaking solution tailored to empower this generation in their financial journey. Recognizing the pivotal role of education in investment and acknowledging the limitations of time and information overload that Gen Z faces, our product offers an intuitive visualization of potential financial outcomes, all while addressing their current necessities, ut also emphasizes the impact of their investments on the world by incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) indicators. This dual approach educates and empowers Gen Z investors to envision not just personal gains but also the broader implications of their investment choices, fostering a generation of conscientious investors who understand the significance of sustainable and ethical investing for a better future.

<!-- TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
## Technologies Used

Our project is built on Python for backend operations and JavaScript to animate the front-end, delivering a robust and interactive user experience. GitHub hosts our website and facilitates smooth team collaboration and version control. We integrate real-time financial data through API connections to the SIX Group, providing essential market insights. Visual elements and designs are created with Canva, ensuring our platform is visually engaging for Gen Z investors. These technologies are the cornerstone of our tool, designed to demystify investing for the new generation.

<!-- Challenge Faced and Learnings-->
## Challenge Faced and Learnings

Among the challenges we faced in developing our project was the task of distilling complex financial indicators into an accessible format for Gen Z individuals, many of whom are just beginning their investment journey and possess limited financial knowledge. We recognized the crucial need to simplify these concepts without diluting their significance, thereby enabling a seamless educational experience for our users.

To address this challenge, we employed a creative approach, drawing from our unique position as members of the Gen Z cohort ourselves. This familiarity with our target audience gave us a valuable perspective on how to intertwine the cutting-edge trends of financial literacy with the principles of sustainability—a concept that resonates deeply with our generation. By doing so, we've managed to not just educate but also engage our peers, encouraging them to make investment choices that are both financially sound and aligned with the values of environmental and social responsibility.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
As we chart the course for our project's growth post-hackathon, the roadmap for our dynamic investment tool tailored for Gen Z investors is taking a definitive shape. Currently, we have a fundamental prototype of our website that showcases our commitment to simplicity and functionality. Leveraging API connections to the SIX Group, we provide our users with reliable and real-time access to the Swiss stock market data.

At this juncture, our platform offers three key indicators: end-of-day stock prices, volatility metrics, and market capitalization figures, each chosen for their relevance and ease of comprehension for novice investors. As we move forward, we plan to enhance our platform's capabilities, incorporating more diverse and robust datasets, and expanding our indicator offerings to provide a more comprehensive analytical tool.

Our immediate next steps include refining the user interface for an engaging user experience, integrating additional APIs for a broader market scope, and developing educational content to demystify investment principles. We are also prioritizing the inclusion of interactive elements that allow users to simulate investment strategies and visualize potential outcomes.

We invite our community to join us on this journey, contribute ideas, and provide feedback that will shape the evolution of our platform. Stay tuned for updates on new features and improvements as we strive to make investment insights more accessible and actionable for the emerging generation of investors.
